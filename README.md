## About Junia
Have you ever wanted to have a rather low-level game engine to easily create 2D Games without having to think about all the libraries necessary to even run a Hello World program? Junia is exactly what you are looking for! The engine is a easy-to-use library based on SDL2 that handles all the annoying time-consuming stuff already for you! Quickly create a window and display your sprites for prototyping with just a few lines of code! In case you want to get into SDL2 or OpenGL this is also a great starting point since you can get used to the higher-level stuff first before heading down a rabbit hole of giving up and destroying your PC.

## Using the engine source Code
In case you want to change a few things about how the engine works or fix bugs yourself you can always file a pull-request. Although to do that you first have to get the project running. Follow these simple steps to setup the project on your windows machine:

1. Install Visual Studio 2019 or newer (VS Comunity is free) from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/
2. When installing select at least the C++ Desktop development package
3. Install git precompiled binaries for windows from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
4. Run the git bash and use `cd path` to navigate to a folder of your choosing
5. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/hiwiscifi/junia`
6. Open the Junia.sln file using Visual Studio
7. Build & Run the Junia_Test Project to check if everything has been installed correctly
8. You're ready to go!
